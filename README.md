# MyPlantWeb
## Plantae
Hi, I'm Rodrigo, a student from Spain.
The final project I will end up doing in English, in the meantime I will do it myself in Spanish, it is the beginning of my first project as a front-end developer.
The idea of this project is to make a website about a fictitious plant store. The website will have a lot of sections, and I will be using the APIs to get the data from the website.
